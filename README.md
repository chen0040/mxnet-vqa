### Training with GPU

Note that the default training scripts in the [demo](demo) folder use GPU for training, therefore, you must configure your

* Step 1: Download and install the [CUDA® Toolkit 9.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive) (you should download CUDA® Toolkit 9.0)
* Step 2: Download and unzip the [cuDNN 7.0.4 for CUDA@ Toolkit 9.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and add the
bin folder of the unzipped directory to the $PATH of your Windows environment
